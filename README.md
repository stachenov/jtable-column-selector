# jtable-column-selector
A class to select displayed columns in a Swing JTable

The idea is to have a context menu on the table header so that the user can select which columns to display. That is, without affecting the table model at all.

Right now it's a work in progress, but a ready-to-use version should appear pretty soon. On the other hand, it isn't intended to be production quality, just something to start with. The users will probably want to tweak the code to suit their needsâ€”and that's fine! That's what GitHub is for, among other things.

A very similar work can be found here:
